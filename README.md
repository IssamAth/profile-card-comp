## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind - CSS Framework
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This challenge is great for those people who wants to try new design frameworks or even try CSS for the first time.


### Continued development

I'm gonna be doing more React & Tailwind projects, just to feel more comfortable with its tools. Hence why I'm going to be using em in most of my incoming projects.
